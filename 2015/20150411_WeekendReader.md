### [Don't use Microservices](http://samnewman.io/blog/2015/04/07/microservices-for-greenfield/)
The hype curve for [microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) seems to have reached a plateau. [The article](http://samnewman.io/blog/2015/04/07/microservices-for-greenfield/)  suggests that a microservices architecture might not be a good fit for new (greefield) applications. There seem to be quite some reasons why not to use micorservices actually. I like the dicussion, however I think it's not specific to microservices, but applies to any decoubled service-oriented architecture ... any many failed SOA projects have probably suffered from the pitfalls described.


### [The salary of programmers](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015#work-complang)
It was a topic already in [my last weekend reader](http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2015/04/weekend-reader-14.html). This week we get more information about that topic from the [Stackoverflow Developer Survey 2015](http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2015). There are many interesting/surprising insights:
- Developers in the US are much better paid than in Western Europe 
- Objective-C and Node.js development pays best. 
- You should not be a Java developer if you are in it for the money.
- Developers who work remotely earn significantly more than non-remote workers (probably this is a symptom not a cause: good developers are hired for remote work)
- Mobile developers are more satisfied with their job than other developers. 
- Product manager and quality assurance are among the least satisfying jobs



### [The Rise of TypeScript](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/the-rise-of-typescript/)

The decision of the Angular team to build Angular 2 with [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and to treat TypeScript as the best way to write Angular applications puts a lot of momentum behind the TypeScript language. With this step TypeScript will almost certainly leave it current Microsoft-centric niche and be more widely adopted among web developers.


### [JavaScript for Desktop Application Development](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)
Man developers will cringe at that notion. But the "reuse-story" is actually compelling. For example with [Angular](https://angularjs.org/), [Atom Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell) and [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) you have a development stack that is applicable for Web, Desktop and Mobile.

More links for that topis:
- [Atom Shell Starter](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell-starter) (base application skeleton)
- Alternative: [NW.js](http://nwjs.io/) (formely known as node-webkit)

### [There is hope for Java](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co/2014/05/01/modern-java/)
Traditional Java development has grown old and cumbersome compared with many other platforms/languages and it has a hard time keeping up with many current software developement trends.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Trying to do modern web development with the traditional Java approach (WAR, Maven) seems to be the ultimate productivity killer ...</p>&mdash; Jonas Bandi (@jbandi) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbandi/status/584334301086482434">April 4, 2015</a></blockquote>

### Geek Sarcasm: [Could it be that programmers have been human all along](http://kranglefant.tumblr.com/post/115503794320/could-it-be-that-programmers-have-been-human-all)?
An nice tale from Christin Gorman (watch her [all-time-highlight-hilarious lightning talk](https://vimeo.com/28885655)) about a project far away from the idiocy of [enterprise application] (http://martinfowler.com/bliki/EnterpriseApplication.html) development.
