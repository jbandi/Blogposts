### [A look at the United States Digital Service (USDS) - An agency to save government IT projects that got on the wrong track](https://medium.com/backchannel/the-tiny-team-taking-on-a-massive-reform-of-government-it-b5f87b85e2dc)

> The original enrollment system cost \$200 million and would have required \$70 million a year to maintain. The new version of the site cost \$4 million to produce, with annual maintenance costs also \$4 million.

There is a lot of debate [whether the 10x developer is reality or not](http://www.quora.com/Is-the-concept-of-a-10x-engineer-valid). But this article proves that the **10x team** is definitely reality.
But the article also points out that it does not (only) depend on the people in the team, but also on the project setup: Is the team in a position to make a difference, or is it helplessly entangled in bureaucracy. 

> The biggest foe is generally risk aversion. People in government are trained to not do things differently because there’s often really bad consequences when you try something differently and it fails. We run up against this all the time

I also find the philosophy how the USDS attracts people and forms teams very interesting:

> We don’t make career hires. We’re not building a career organization. [...] We are relentless about trying to hang onto the ruthless mission focus here. We are built for short term appointments.



### Agile: [No. Agile Does Not Scale.](https://medium.com/@jurgenappelo/no-agile-does-not-scale-98df99da3ff3)

> At small scale, Agile is great. At large scale, Agile is stupid.

Jurgen Appelo, the author of [Management 3.0](https://management30.com/), gives his thought about the recent attempts to scale Agile and the fundamental flaw that at the base of all those methodologies that want to apply existing Agile practices at large:

> Scaling Agile is indeed a problem, because the Manifesto doesn’t scale
> in the first place. It was intended to describe small projects, not
> large enterprises.


### Agile:  It used to be simple

It is sad where Agile has ended up:

### Agile: [Simplicity and Unscaling](http://rgalen.com/agile-training-news/2015/5/24/the-newest-craze-in-agile-simplicity-and-un-scaling)

> As we introduce agility into larger instances, we're losing the very essence of agility that made it attractive in the first place.

> We don't have a scaling problem, we have a "trying to throw too many  people at it" problem. We have a "love of size and scope" problem.


### Work: [Living in Switzerland ruined me for America and its lousy work culture](http://www.vox.com/2015/7/21/8974435/switzerland-work-life-balance)

So, I guess I should feel privileged to be born in Switzerland ...
