My year 2014 was interesting and brought many changes from a professional and personal perspective.

From the **personal perspective** I had two great vacations: I was literally beginning the year under water on [a great dive trip in Raja Ampat](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbandi/sets/72157641628637623/). Diving with oceanic mantas was something I will never forget:

And [my mountainbiking vacation in Colorado/Utah](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbandi/sets/72157645215658965/) was another extraordinary experience:

However the probably much more profound event in my personal life came in October with the birth of our first child:

From the **professional perspective** I started to do much more teaching in 2014.
My engagement at the Berner Fachhochschule was expanded an I am teaching a mayor part in the new [CAS (Course of Advanced Studies) "Multiplatform Development with HTML5"](http://www.ti.bfh.ch/cas-html5) and a smaller part in the [CAS Mobile Application Development](http://www.ti.bfh.ch/en/weiterbildung/informatik_it/cas_angebot/cas_md).

During the year I was giving quite a lot of inhose courses for JavaScript development and AngularJS. These courses range from 1 day bootcamps to 4 day workshops. I held courses for [UBS](http://www.ubs.com/), [BIT](http://www.bit.admin.ch/), [Puzzle ITC](http://www.puzzle.ch/), [Glue](http://www.glue.ch/), [IMS AG](http://www.ims.ch/), [ESGroup](http://enterprisesoftwaregroup.com/#/) and I could again give my JavaScript Bootcamp twice at the [ch/open Workshoptage](http://www.ch-open.ch/wstage/workshop-tage/).

I enjoy working in the emerging space of "JavaScript as a serious application platform" so much, that I quit my job as a architect at my [former employer](http://www.cgm.com/ch/index.de.jsp). I am now working as a freelance developer and trainer with my own company.
The adoption of JavaScript in enterprise application development is the area I am currently focusing on. I am offering courses for professional JavaScript development, for [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and for architecting modern html5 based frontends for enterprise systems. 

Currently there are almost no public courses to learn those topics. In the typical educational institutions JavaScript is still pinned to the space of "Web-Design". Thats where I try to offer my inhouse courses: I specifically target typical enterprise environments and enterprise developers (Java or .NET) and I try to show the similarities between the modern JavaScript ecosystem and the traditional enterprise plaforms and also the pitfalls of JavaScript. I tailor my courses to the specific needs of each of the individual team. 

For the coming months I have already engagements for more courses at [Postfinance](https://www.postfinance.ch/) and at [Mobiliar](https://www.mobi.ch) and I am looking forward to work with more teams. If you are interested in setting up a JavaScript/AngularJS/React course or coaching for a development team, please [contact me](mailto:network@jonasbandi.net).

There are also public courses scheduled, where I will be teaching:

- Digicomp: [Einf√ºhrung in die Frontend-Entwicklung mit JavaScript und AngularJS](https://www.digicomp.ch/de/weiterbildung/softwareentwicklung/web-und-mobile-app-entwicklung/webentwicklung/einfuehrung-in-die-frontend-entwicklung-mit-javascript-und-angularjs)
- [BBV Academy: Professional JavaScript Development for Java & .NET Developers](https://www.bbv.ch/de/bbv-academy)

Starting from April I will also be looking for opportunities to work hands-on in interesting projects. Of course my preference would be to work in projects where JavaScript and enterprise systems intersect.
