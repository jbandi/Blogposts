### [You Might Have Too Many Developers](http://curtiscooley.com/too_many_dev)
An argument in favor of small teams and small incremental projects.
> Why are we still talking about scaling agile with things like [SAFe](http://www.scaledagileframework.com/) when the root problem is you might have too many developers?



### [There are no unicorns: forget about "better developers", address organizational dysfunctions](http://agileotter.blogspot.ch/2015/04/too-many-developers.html)
(in response to the article above)  
>Size may be the symptom of organizational dysfunction.  

> It goes wrong when we try to make management easier by treating knowledge work as if it were physical work.
  
>Industrial-age management is a really bad system for managing software development.

### [Don't use Microservices](http://blog.xebialabs.com/2015/04/13/before-you-go-over-the-container-cliff-with-docker-mesos-etc-points-to-consider/)
As in my [previous Weekend Reader](http://blog.jonasbandi.net/2015/04/weekend-reader-week-15.html), here is [another article](http://blog.xebialabs.com/2015/04/13/before-you-go-over-the-container-cliff-with-docker-mesos-etc-points-to-consider/) that has a good discussions about challenges and problems when trying to adopt microservices. 


### [Classes: A bad Idea?](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3)
The next version of JavaScript (EcmaScript 6) will add classes to the language. Classes are available in many object-oritented languages, and most developers who learned object-orientation the traditional way (C++, Java, C#) might be wondering how object-orientation is even possible without classes.

However Douglas Crockford, the author of "[JavaScript the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596517742&linkCode=as2&tag=cl02fb-20&linkId=ERSZRQVG24WY3HQK)", thinks that the introduction of classes in JavScript [might not be a good idea](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=30m50s):

> Classes in EcmaScript 6 are gonna be a bad part. ([direct link](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=30m50s))
> The gift of JavaScript to humanity is class-free object-oriented programming. ([direct link](https://youtu.be/bo36MrBfTk4?t=33m38s))

<br/>
In the ["The Two Pillars of JavaScript"](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3) we get a similar opinion from Eric Elliott, the author of “[Programming JavaScript Applications](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491950293/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1491950293&linkCode=as2&tag=cl02fb-20&linkId=OXCYZNSI4QUTQ4YZ)” who argues also against classes:

> You never need classes in JavaScript, and I have never seen a situation where class is a better approach than the alternatives.

Toptal has published some [nice short videos](http://www.toptal.com/videos), each describing a advanced concept of Angular. Perfect fill-ins for a short break.

Geeky. But never underestimate what you can do with JavaScript ...

### [Funny Advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yD7NC2Urdw)
Everybody complains about the ever more aggressive advertisement on YouTube, however if YouTube presents me advertisement like this, I gladly watch it to the end ... and I then search for the clip on YouTube to watch it again:
