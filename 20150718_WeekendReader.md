### [The Software Paradox](http://thesoftwareparadox.com/)
A short book about the rise and fall of the commercial software market.


### [Product Backlog Bankruptcy!](http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/product-backlog-bankruptcy) 
I have been in teams where the effort to maintain (the illusion of) a backlog was just rediculous ... the idea to declare the product backlog bankruptcy makes sense to me.


### [Agile & Scrum Go Mainstream](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2015/06/14/coding-agile-scrum-go-mainstream/)
Ok, many teams in software development have moved past the scrum hype ... but general management seems to just start discovering it.

> Scrum is a Copernican revolution in management.

... I remain sceptical.


### [Monolith First](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html)
Martin Fowler about the current hype around microservices:

> You shouldn't start a new project with microservices, even if you're
> sure your application will be big enough to make it worthwhile.


### Microservices and JavaEE: No paradox?
JavaEE desperately tries to be fashIonable by squeezing traditional application servers in the corset of microservices ... I wonder if this is a good aproach:

- [Payara Micro](https://www.voxxed.com/blog/2015/05/payara-micro/) 
- [KumuluzEE](http://ee.kumuluz.com/)


### [The birth and death of JavaScript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript)
Another great talk ([WAT](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) is a classic!) by Gary Bernhard. Watch out for the point where he crosses from reality to fiction ...



### [Some people seem pretty crazy](https://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html)
How [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) uses computers: 

> I usually fetch web pages from other sites by sending mail to a
> program that fetches them, and then mails them back to me.

I am in awe at all the obstacles he is willing to take on by staying true to his principles.
