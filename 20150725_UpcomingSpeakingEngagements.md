I will hold my workshop "[JavaScript for real Developers: A survival Bootcamp](https://www.ch-open.ch/wstage/workshop-tage/programm/ws-1-javascript-for-real-developers-ein-survival-bootcamp/)".
I have been holding workshops at the "[ch/open Workshoptage](https://www.ch-open.ch/wstage/workshop-tage/programm/)" for the last 9 years, and I think it is one of the best tech event in Switzerland.
It's the third time I hold the "JavaScript for real Developers" workshop at the "ch/open Workshoptage" (but I have held the same content at many [in-house trainings](http://www.ivorycode.com/#schulung)). The last two years the workshop was always fully booked in a short period of time.

I am proud that I was invited for the fifth time to speak at the annual SBB Developer Day on September 9th. I will give an introduction to TypeScript.
I will give a talk titled ["JavaScript - Past, Present, Future"](https://ssl.hostpark.net/bkaiser.ch/sise/2015/program.html).
