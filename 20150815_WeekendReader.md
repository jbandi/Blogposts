### [Tudor Girba on .NET Rocks](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1172)
.NET Rocks is still one of my favorite podcast. In [this episode](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1172) my collegue Tudor talks about his ideas of modern software development, especially about reading code an source code analysis. 
A very interesting conversation, Tudor is very eloquent as always. But Richard also cuts to the chase at the end: "This all sounds very academic" ... listen to the conversation and judge for yourself.

### No Estimates: [A critique by Steve McConnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55tfYRajpFI&feature=youtu.be) 
The [NoEstimates](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=#noestimates) movement is a new trend in Agile that critizises many Agile methodologies that set heavy focus on planning and therefore spend a lot of effort for estimating. 
The proponents of the NoEstimate movement argue that Software Development essentially is [nothing](http://blog.tablexi.com/2013/01/why-building-software-is-not-like-building-a-house/developers/) like [building housese](http://www.wired.com/2013/01/code-bugs-programming-why-we-need-specs/) but rather like building a science theory (do you think Einstein estimated how long it would take him to figure out relativity theory?). 
As a conclusion software estimation is mostly a farce according to NoEstimates:

It seems that the NoEstimates movement now gained momentum, when the famous author [Steve McConnell](http://www.stevemcconnell.com/) deems to reply with a video:

### No Estimates: [The Reply of Ron Joffries ](http://ronjeffries.com/articles/015-jul/mcconnell/) 
Ron Joffries, one of the main proponents of [NoEstimates](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=#noestimates), has an elaborate reply to Steve McDonnell where he shows flaws in the arguments of McDonnel and defends the ideas behind NoEstimates.

### JavaScript: [Universal JavaScript at Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2015/08/making-netflixcom-faster.html)
Netflix introduced JavaScript on the server to reuse the same logic on the server and the client.

> Context switching between languages was not ideal.

After [PayPal announced switching all their Java code to JavaScript](http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-replacing-java-with-javascript-is-paying-off-for-paypal/) this is another big company investing heavily on JavScript on the server.

### JavaScript: [Using Server Side Javascript with Wildfly](http://wildfly.org/news/2015/08/10/Javascript-Support-In-Wildfly/)
JBoss, the traditional Java server, jumps the bandwaggon and introduces support for server-side JavaScript. Interesting ... probably the first sensible usage of [Nashorn](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/jf14-nashorn-2126515.html) I have seen so far (after [Project Avatar](https://avatar.java.net/) was [killed by Oracle](https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/project_avatar_update))

But what I find even more interesting is the new hot deployment mechanism that allows you to map the web content root to your local workspace. This migth be a huge productivity boost for Java web development ... so I might have to revise my tweet:

### Oldie but Goodie: [Gavin King about ORM](http://www.javaperformancetuning.com/news/interview041.shtml)

> It turns out that ORM is a difficult problem, in subtle ways. It always looks simpler from the outside than it turns out to be once you start getting your hands dirty.
 
> People try to apply ORM where it is not really suitable.
