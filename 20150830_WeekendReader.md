### Web Dev: [Stop pushing the web forward](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/07/stop_pushing_th.html)

Peter Paul Koch of [QuirksMode](http://www.quirksmode.org/) argues that we are maneuvering the web into a dead end. Instead of trying to compete with native apps by cramming more and more features into browsers, we should focus on the web’s strengths: simplicity, URLs and reach.

> We get ever more features that become ever more complex and need ever more polyfills and other tools to function — tools that are part of the problem, and not of the solution.

The supported migration scenario from Angular 1 to Angular 2 will not be based on the Angular New Router (aka. Component Router) any more. The Angular team [posted a sophisticated plan](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/08/angular-1-and-angular-2-coexistence.html) how migration will look like. It looks interesting, but as far as I gather it's still only a plan, the bits are not available yet ...


### WebDev: [Phoenix Framework 1.0](http://www.phoenixframework.org/blog)
The hype moves on: [Elixr](http://elixir-lang.org/) seems to get traction. And the [Phoenix Framework](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) is certainly worth having a look at for modern web development ...


### Online Education: [A lucrative business](http://blog.pluralsight.com/online-educations-millionaire-teacher)
Online courses are sprouting out of the internet like mushrooms in autumn ... I for myself have currently a subscription to [Pluralshigt](http://www.pluralsight.com/) and to [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/). But there is so much more ...
