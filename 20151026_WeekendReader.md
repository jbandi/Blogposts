### [Angular Connect](http://angularconnect.com/)

Last Week was the [Angular Connect conference](http://angularconnect.com/) in London.  
Unfortunately Angular 2 is still alpha ... the highly awaited beta version was not released at the conference.  
Besides Angular 2, [r](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) seem to be the technologies that you should start to look into for future develoment with Angular.
The sessions are [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzrskTiT_ObAk3xBkVxMz5g), I am still catching up, but the qualtity of most sessions is very high.

The Angular team also updated [the docs for Angular 2](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/), definitely worth looking at ...

### [The State of JavaScript on Android](https://meta.discourse.org/t/the-state-of-javascript-on-android-in-2015-is-poor/33889)

> the fastest known Android device available today performs 5× slower than a new iPhone 6s, and a little worse than a 2012 era iPhone 5

[The post](https://meta.discourse.org/t/the-state-of-javascript-on-android-in-2015-is-poor/33889) is highly interesting. It seems that iPhone users are much better off using modern web sites and the Android ecosystem is actually threatening to hold back the advancement of web technologies ...
