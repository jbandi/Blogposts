### [Highlights from AngularConnect 2015 ](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/11/highlights-from-angularconnect-2015.html)

The post is a very [good overview](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/11/highlights-from-angularconnect-2015.html) about the progress of Angular 1 and 2.

Angular 1 ist still making progress. I am looking forward to the [component syntax](http://toddmotto.com/exploring-the-angular-1-5-component-method/) and also to the component router and the new internationalization features which both are shared with Angular 2.

I am a bit concerned about the ever growing scope of Angular 2: 
- They plan to deliver their own command line interface called Angular-CLI for integrated tooling
- They want to support APIs in 4 languages: ES5, ES6, TypeScript and Dart
- They want to support the MV* pattern but also the Flux pattern for separation of concerns
- They want to support different rendering targets besides html to support native mobile applications
- They want to use WebWorkers to run most of the Angular code in a seperate process

I am really curious how all these features will turn out in regard to complexity and developer experience.


### JavaScript Community in Bern
Just a reminder for the "[Bâ€°rner JS Talks](https://twitter.com/bernerJS)" happening [next wednesday](http://techup.ch/2203/brner-js-talks).

Very interesting topics, I am looking forward to all of the three talks.


### The Thing about Bower
There is something going on around [bower](http://bower.io/)...

It was [proclaimed dead on redit](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/3sol5h/bower_development_effectively_stopped/)

One reason for that proclamaition was [this discussion on github](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1748#issuecomment-150104311).

As a reaction the bower team posted the following post: [Bower is alive, looking for contributors](http://bower.io/blog/2015/bower-alive-looking-contributors/) and started a [crowd funding initiative](https://salt.bountysource.com/teams/bower).

Meantime in the Microsoft World, VisualStudio is still betting on the bower horse and improved the [integration with a new Bower Package Manager UI for ASP.NET 5.](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/11/18/announcing-asp-net-5-release-candidate-1.aspx)

Personally I am currently a fan of modern JavaScript workflows based on [NPM/Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [JSPM](http://jspm.io/) ... no bower for me anymore.

If you want to get rid of bower, the following post might be a good starting point: [Why We Should Stop Using Bower  And How to Do It](http://gofore.com/ohjelmistokehitys/stop-using-bower/)

Kyle Simpson ist known for [having other opinions](https://twitter.com/getify/status/664488153097502720) about "best practices" in JavaScript. In this video he questions many common practices and rules of current JavaScript programming. 

### [Business: Nobody Wants Your App](https://medium.com/swlh/nobody-wants-your-app-6af1f7f69cb7#.ul2ehz4fx)
An interesting article as an interesting following up on "[Dont base your business on a paid app](https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3956-dont-base-your-business-on-a-paid-app)"

[The article](https://medium.com/swlh/nobody-wants-your-app-6af1f7f69cb7#.ul2ehz4fx) shows the story of a startup that wanted to create an app ... and was not that successful.
Interesting is that they had a good visibility, but nobody wanted to download for the app:

> One download for every one thousand web views.

The conclusion: 

> The app world is so bloated, its overwhelming to the consumer.

I see that effect myself: Some years ago I was browsing the App store to detect new cool Apps, but now I can't remember when I actually opened an App Store the last time...



### Tools: [Classeur](http://classeur.io/)
I am using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) a lot. For my courses and for blogging. But I am still looking for my favorite Markdown tooling. For some time I have been using StackEdit for blogging. Recently I discovered [Classeur.io](http://classeur.io/) which makes a neat impression. I am writing this post right now in Classeur ...


### Programming Humor: [FizzBuzz Enterprise Edition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition)

[Fizz Buzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is a famous programming exercise, suggested to be used in [programming interviews](http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/). A solution in JavaScript might look [like this](https://gist.github.com/jaysonrowe/1592432).

Somebody made an [enterprise version of Fizz Buzz in Java](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) ... Hilarious!
