### [Angular 2 is officially beta](http://angularjs.blogspot.ch/2015/12/angular-2-beta.html)

> We're now confident that most developers can be successful building large applications using Angular 2.

[The developer guides](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/) are already amazingly polished. If you have not yet started to look into this new framework, now is a good time.


### [We have closed the hype-cycle](https://angularclass.com/angular-2-for-react-developers/)
[The post](https://angularclass.com/angular-2-for-react-developers/) is a good high-level overview comparing the basic concepts of React and Angular 2.

At the beginning of the year we have seen [posts that were explaining React](http://www.stridenyc.com/blog/coming-to-react-from-angular/) to developers that know Angular. Now we have posts that explain Angular 2 to developers that know React... 

### [Angular 2 for Desktop Apps](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/)

Angular 2 promises to be a framework not only for web development but also for mobile development. [This article](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/12/15/create-a-desktop-app-with-angular-2-and-electron/) show how the reach can even be extended to the Desktop by using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).


### [Jazoon in Bern: The future of Web Development](http://jazoon.com/)

On April 4th there will take place the [Jazoon TechDays](http://jazoon.com/) on the beautiful Gurten. Traditionally Jazoon was a multi-track Java conference. For the next year however the organizers came up with a new concept of a one-day conference that focuses on a single topic. The topic for the upcoming conference in Bern is "The Future of Web Development" and they already have an interesting line-up of speakers (and I heard the rumor that there will even be more international speakers announced soon ...).
I suggest you should get your ticket for that event soon, even if you are not living in Bern. I was lucky and could convince [my employer](http://www.ivorycode.com/) to sponser my ticket :-)

### [Redux Screencast](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)
Dan Abramov, the creator of [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), created an amazing series of screencasts for Egghead. It is one of the most instructive screencasts I have watched the whole year. And it is available for free!
If you want to learn about [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) and how it approaches the ideas of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) you should definitely watch these short lessons.
But even if Redux/Flux is not a topic that interests you, the screencasts teach a lot about using ES6 and test-driven development in JavaScript. 


### [The future of JavaScript is (almost) now](http://sdtimes.com/the-future-of-javascript-is-almost-now/)

> Every once in a while, a piece of technology is situated in the right place at the right time, and it ends up taking over the world. [...] ES6 is new foundation for what may be the most important programming language of the next several decades.

The article is good overview over the JavaScript ecosystem today and its relevance in the future.

### [The End of Dynamic Languages](http://elbenshira.com/blog/the-end-of-dynamic-languages/)

> Working in dynamic languages is fine if youâ€™re just *adding* a feature on top of the pile of features. But anything else is impossibly difficult.

Not everybody agrees with the future relevance of JavaScript. According to the article the time for dynamic languages is over and it is time to move on.
